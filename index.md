## 🛠 Key Development & Data Engineering Projects

### **1. Water Meter Anomaly Detection System (AI-Powered Backend)**
* **Role:** Lead Developer & Researcher
* **Description:** Architected a backend system to filter and detect abnormal water meters by integrating 4 years of historical usage data and over 140,000 meter attributes from PWA's CIS and MMS databases.
* **Implementation:** * Applied **DBSCAN** for outlier removal and Z-score for data quality improvement.
    * Engineered novel spatial features (e.g., distance to pipe repairs, repair density).
    * Developed predictive models using **XGBoost, LSTM, and Stacking Ensembles**.
* **Impact:** Achieved a high F1-Score of **0.90 - 0.96**, significantly reducing the workload for field surveys and increasing revenue through the targeted replacement of defective meters.

### **2. Thai Geoparsing & Geolocation Estimation Tool**
* **Role:** Researcher & Developer
* **Description:** Developed an advanced Python library/tool to extract location names from unstructured Thai text (Twitter) and estimate geographic coordinates without relying on traditional Geocoding APIs.
* **Implementation:** * Utilized **WangchanBERTa** and Bi-LSTM-CRF for Named Entity Recognition (NER).
    * Created the **Topology Words** algorithm to calculate coordinates based on the spatial relationships of adjacent locations mentioned in the text.

### **3. Geospatial Data Pipeline, API & AI Integration**
* **Role:** Backend & AI Developer
* **Description:** Designed and maintained robust backend infrastructure for geospatial data handling.
* **Implementation:** * Developed automated OCR data entry systems using **Python, FastAPI, and ORM**, hosted on Railway.com.
    * Managed large-scale **PostgreSQL/PostGIS** databases, optimizing spatial queries and developing Python scripts for automated data extraction (e.g., migrating MongoDB spatial data to Shapefiles).
    * Integrated **LangChain and LLMs** to build Text-to-SQL systems for natural language database querying.
